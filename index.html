                <h2>Destiny 2, what armor chest piece is the best for Titans?</h2>

                <p><img src="destiny.jpg" title="blogpic" alt="Destiny 2 from the popular video game Destiny 2"></p>

                <p>Destiny 2 is a popular MMO/FPS that made its debue on September 6, 2017 
                and it took the nation by storm. Destiny 2 is known for having its stylus and buffed gear
                thats offered to the users who play the game however, one question always stands amongst players,
                which armor chest piece is the best one in the game for the class of Titans?</p>

                <p>Well, after doing extensive research I can provide an answer to most players that will be 
                deemed as satisfactory. If you are looking to build a strong titan class then your first priority would be the 
                <em>The Heart of Inmost Light</em> with high discipline and recovery stats. If you are interested in adding 
                Mods to your gear, "Bountiful Wells" would be your go to. With this Chest Piece you would want to run
                the <em>Solar Subclass.</em></p>

                <p>This chest piece will provide an overall advantage that will be able to serparate you from your opponents.
                With this piece, you'll be able to conduct raids, do strikes, run dungeons, and face off with other players
                in the pvp game modes. No other piece in the game can compare to this one if you're looking to buff your titan.
                Who knows, maybe a new piece will arise that will surpass this one in the future. If thats the case then back to
                the books for me.</p>

                <h2>The return of MWII</h2>

                <p><img src="mw2.png" title="blogpic" alt="New Logo for remake of Modern Warfare Call Of Duty"></p>

                <p>Call of Duty recently announced their world premier for the remake of Modern Warfare 2 on june 8rd of 2022.
                This is getting people really excited since this game was last released in 2009 so a remake is overdue. I've always
                enjoyed the Modern Warfare games and to see a childhood favorite being re-released is really exciting. These games
                always do well at inital launch and odds are this one will have a succussful one too.</p>

                <p>When it comes to playing any type of Call Of Duty, its best enjoyed when its played with friends. This game 
                will continue to offer its use of multiplayer so that other users are able to still play with their friends.
                One concern that many people have, including me, is how much this game is going to cost however we wont know until they
                do their premeir. Many can assume that the price will be the same as always, being at $60, yet it is not certain due to
                everything that has happened within the past couple years. The price could be much higher.</p>

                <p>Overall, this game will reshape how people look at the Call of Duty franchise. Being able to continue to play with
                your friends will surely real back in lost Call of Duty fans. This game has held close to my heart and I hope it does
                the same for younger generations.</p>
