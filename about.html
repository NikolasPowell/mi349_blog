        <p><img src="image0.jpeg" title="blogpic" alt="Picture of Author"></p>

        <p>Hello! My name is Nikolas Powell and I am currently a Senior at Michigan State University. I am pursuing
        my masters in Information Science as well as a double minor in Information Technology and Security Management. I
        decided to go with MSU due to its outstanding academic curricular programs and amazing professors. The most favorate
        part about going to MSu is the football games that happen during the fall semester.</p>

        <p>Currently I am unemployed however I did previously work for Apple as one of the Technical Support Specialists. What
        interests me the most is Cybersecurity and what we can do to secure our networks. I will continue the knowledge that I 
        gained during my work experience and to be able to apply it to other future endevours. </p>

        <p>Here are a couple of things I like to do in my spare time: </p>
            <ul class="Interests">
                <li>Video Games</li>
                <li>Weight Lifting</li>
                <li>Hanging Out With Friends</li>
                <li>Snowboarding</li>
            </ul>

        <p>I hope that my skills within HTML will improve so that I am able to create more elaborate and complex websites
        that will be viewed by millions! Thank you for visiting my page!</p>

        <p>Yours Truely, Nikolas Powell</p>
